# Tasting Experience
This project contains a website where you can book a classy tasting session with your family and friends. You can book three different kinds of tasting:

- Whiskey tasting
- Wine tasting
- Beer tasting

Each tasting has its own theme. These themes includes the location, suitable snacks and appropriate music to enhance the overall tasting experience. Participants will get info about the different kind of drinks, how to drink them and what is the history behind it.

The website will provide a calendar, location and pricing of the booking. Also, you can fill in a contact form to give feedback about new ideas or tastings.

# Motivation
This website is a part of the first milestone project of the Code Institute software developer course. I wanted to build this website in order to inspire people for entertainment for your family or friends.

# Features
The website will contain five pages.

#### Home page
The home page will contain general info about the creator and the idea of the website. You can view a gallery of tasting sessions and user reviews will be shown as well. A short summary of the available tasting is shown and from here you can click to these pages (aside of the header).

#### Tastings
There will be three tasting pages with all the same layout. A general description with tasting specific information will be available. The drinks that will be available at the tasting are shown (with pictures) as is some general information about the location and booking/pricing information.

#### Contact
The contacting page will be 'simple' form page, where you could provide some feedback to the owners of the website.
